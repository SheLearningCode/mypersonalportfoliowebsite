## Tech Stack

- **React**: Frontend framework for building interactive user interfaces.
  - *Advantages*: Offers component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability. Provides a virtual DOM for efficient rendering and performance optimization.
  - *Disadvantages*: Steep learning curve for beginners. May introduce overhead for small projects.

- **Three.js**: Library for creating 3D graphics in the browser.
  - *Advantages*: Enables creation of complex 3D scenes and animations directly in the browser. Provides extensive documentation and a large community for support.
  - *Disadvantages*: Requires knowledge of WebGL and 3D rendering concepts. Performance can be an issue for highly detailed scenes on low-end devices.

- **Blender**: 3D modeling software used for creating custom 3D models and animations.
  - *Advantages*: Offers powerful tools for modeling, texturing, and animation. Supports a wide range of file formats and plugins.
  - *Disadvantages*: Steep learning curve due to its extensive feature set. May require significant time investment to master.

- **Mixamo**: Online platform for rigging and animating 3D characters.
  - *Advantages*: Provides a vast library of pre-rigged characters and animations. Simplifies the process of rigging and animating 3D models.
  - *Disadvantages*: Limited customization options compared to manual rigging. Requires an internet connection to access the platform.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling web applications.
  - *Advantages*: Offers a highly customizable and responsive design system. Reduces the need for writing custom CSS by providing utility classes.
  - *Disadvantages*: Can lead to larger CSS file sizes and increased specificity. Requires learning a new approach to CSS styling.

- **Vite**: Build tool for fast and efficient web development.
  - *Advantages*: Offers blazing fast build times and hot module replacement for rapid development. Supports modern JavaScript features out of the box.
  - *Disadvantages*: Relatively new compared to other build tools, which may result in fewer plugins and community support.
